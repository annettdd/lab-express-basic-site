    <h1>this page is about Mark Rutte</h1>
    <article>Mark Rutte (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈmɑrk ˈrʏtə] (About this soundlisten); born 14 February 1967) is a Dutch politician serving as Prime Minister of the Netherlands since 2010 and Leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) since 2006.
        After a career in business, Rutte was appointed State Secretary for Social Affairs and Employment in 2002 by Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), after a coalition agreement guaranteed the VVD several seats in the cabinet. Rutte was subsequently elected to the House of Representatives at the 2003 election. In 2004, he became State Secretary for Education, Culture and Science. After the 2006 Dutch municipal elections, which saw heavy losses for the VVD, the party's leader, Jozias van Aartsen, announced his resignation. Rutte stood the subsequent leadership election, and was elected on 31 May, resigning from the cabinet shortly afterwards. Rutte led his party into the 2006 election weeks later; although the VVD lost six seats, they became the largest party not in government.       
        At the 2010 general election, the VVD won the highest number of votes cast, resulting in them becoming the largest party in the House of Representatives for the first time in the party's history. After lengthy coalition negotiations, Rutte was sworn in as Prime Minister of the Netherlands leading the First Rutte cabinet. When Rutte was sworn in on 14 October 2010, he became the first liberal prime minister in 92 years, and the second-youngest in Dutch history.[1]       
        An impasse on talks on the budget led to his government's early collapse in April 2012, but the subsequent general election saw the VVD won its highest number of seats ever, leading to a coalition between the VVD and the Labour Party. The government became the first to see out its full term since 1998, and while at the 2017 general election the VVD lost seats, it remained the largest party. After a record-long formation period, Rutte agreed a new coalition between the VVD, CDA, D66 and CU parties, and was sworn in for a third term as Prime Minister on 26 October 2017</article>

    <h2>Education and professional life</h2>
    Rutte was born in The Hague, in the province of South Holland,[2] in a Dutch Reformed family. He is the youngest child of Izaäk Rutte (5 October 1909 – 22 April 1988), a merchant, and his second wife, Hermina Cornelia Dilling (13 November 1923 – 13 May 2020), a secretary. Izaäk Rutte worked for a trading company; first as an importer in the Dutch East Indies, later as a director in the Netherlands.[citation needed] His first wife was a sister of his second wife, Petronella Hermanna Dilling (17 March 1910 – 20 July 1945), who died while both were interned in Tjideng, a prisoner of war camp in Batavia, now Jakarta, on 20 July 1945, during World War II.[3][4]   
    Rutte attended the Maerlant Lyceum from 1979 until 1985[5][circular reference], specialising in the arts. Although Rutte's original ambition was to attend a conservatory and become a concert pianist,[6] he went to study history at Leiden University instead, where he obtained a MA degree in 1992.[7] Rutte combined his studies with a position on the board of the Youth Organisation Freedom and Democracy, the youth organisation of the VVD, of which he was the chair from 1988 to 1991.[8]   
    After his studies, Rutte entered the business world, working as a manager for Unilever (and its food subsidiary Calvé). Until 1997, Rutte was part of the human resource department of Unilever, and played a leading role in several reorganisations. Between 1997 and 2000, Rutte was staff manager for Van den Bergh Nederland, a subsidiary of Unilever's. In 2000, Rutte became a member of the Corporate Human Resources Group, and in 2002, he became human resource manager for IgloMora Groep, another subsidiary of Unilever's.[9]    
    Between 1993 and 1997, Rutte was a member of the national board of the VVD. Rutte also served as a member of the VVD candidate committee for the general election of 2002. Rutte was elected as Member of Parliament in 2003.
